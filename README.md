# Social Media App created with MERN stack

### Please run `npm install` in both client and server directory after cloning the project

## Please follow below metioned process to work on this project
    - No code should be directly written on the `main` branch itself
    - Start working on the feature branches : follow the format `feature-branch/feature-branch-name` (ex: feature-branch/header-updates)
        -- to create a feature branch:
              git checkout main
              git pull
              git branch <your-feature-branch-name>
              git checkout <your-feature-branch-name>
    - Merge the feature branch to `dev` branch once the task is completed
    - Once the code is tested on dev and verified, only then dev should be merged to `main` branch
    - Ideally there should be only one merge a day (one resource can take pull and merge all branches rather than all doing it which may cause conflicts)
    - Code should be reviewed and verified by altest 1 peer developer
